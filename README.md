## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Run `npm run install-packages`

In `.env`, set a working API key for TMDb API and Spotify Web API, set the media paths, and set tha base url of the homehost client

######

```env
# packages/client/.env
REACT_APP_HOMEHOST_BASE = "http://localhost:5000"
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/"
REACT_APP_IMDB_BASE = "https://www.imdb.com"

# packages/server/.env
TMDB_KEY = '<api_key>'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = '<client_id>'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = '<client_secret>'

MOVIES_PATH = '/path/to/movies/directory'
TV_PATH = '/path/to/tv/directory'
MUSIC_PATH = '/path/to/music/directory'

DATABASE_URL = 'file:./data/media.db'
CLIENT_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
```

If you dont have keys, you can request API authorization from Spotify at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/, and TMDb at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

### Media

Your media must appear in the absolute path locations set by `.env`. Each media must be in a unique location and cannot share the same directory path(s)

#### Naming conventions

üé• **Movies**

```
<movies_path>
- (subdirectory)?
  - (movie_file_name <TMDb-movie-ID>) (.mp4|.mkv)
```

üì∫ **TV**

```
<tv_path>
- (tv_show_directory_name <TMDb-tv-show-ID>)
  - (S<season_number>E<episode_number> episode_file_name) (.mp4|.mkv)
```

üéµ **Music**

```
<music_path>
- (album_directory_name <Spotify-album-ID>)
  - ((<disc_number>-)?<track_number> track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)
```

Tracks not found on Spotify can be put in a directory titled `Unknown Album` sans disc/ track number

```
<music_path>
- Unknown Album
  - (track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)
```

### Database

Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
Run `npm run db:migrate` to create migrations from schema, apply them, generate the database client
_homehost_ scans the media paths and adds the files to the database
Wait for the async job to finish generating metadata and save
To browse data, run `npm run db:browse` and go to `http://localhost:5555`
To clear all data, run `npm run db:clear`

### Run

Run `npm run start` to start the application
By default, the server port is `5000`, client port is `3000`
Run `npm run start:prod` to start the application as prod (default port is `5000`)
While running, _homehost_ continuously saves and retrieves information for any media that was added, moved or removed
